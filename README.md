### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:
</div>
---

Inception AI is a SaaS platform leveraging ChatGPT to deliver advanced AI functionalities through a user-friendly interface. Designed to streamline workflows and boost productivity, the platform integrates five core AI tools, providing both free and paid tiers to meet various user needs.

## Project Objectives

- **Craft a fully functional and responsive web application**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Implement secure user authentication**: Utilizing Clerk to ensure data privacy and access control.
- **Integrate the ChatGPT API**: For AI-driven text summarization, content creation, sentiment analysis, code generation, and translation.
- **Persistently store user data**: Using Prisma and MySQL for reliable data management.
- **Deliver a deployed prototype**: Hosted on platforms like Vercel.
- **Establish a Kanban board on GitHub**: For transparent development tracking and documentation.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **API Integration**: ChatGPT API
- **Backend**: Next.js 14, Prisma, MySQL
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Project Management**: GitHub Project Khan Board
- **Payments**: Stripe

## Offering Both Free and Paid Tiers

The platform will offer a free tier with limited access and a paid tier that unlocks all five AI tools. Stripe will be integrated for secure and reliable payment processing.

- **Authentication Implementation**: Secure user management with Clerk.
- **Data Persistence**: Set up Prisma and MySQL.
- **Testing and Refinement**: Thorough testing and feedback integration.
- **Deployment and Documentation**: Deploy the final prototype and prepare documentation.

</details>

## Deliverables

- **Functional SaaS AI Platform**: With free and paid tiers.
- **User Documentation**: Guides and tutorials.
- **Project Khan Board**: Detailed development process.
- **Source Code**: With clear comments and explanations.
- **Presentation**: Showcasing goals, achievements, and future potential.

## Conclusion

Inception AI aims to democratize advanced AI functionalities through a user-friendly platform. By integrating ChatGPT and using innovative technologies, the project enhances user productivity and offers flexible pricing, showcasing strong technical expertise and aligning with Capstone objectives.

## **Known Issues**  

The video and audio generation models have occasionally been observed to take an extended time to produce content in deployment. As a result, API requests may time out before a response is received.  

To mitigate this, a `vercel.json` file was introduced to extend the API call timeout to **300 seconds**. The root cause of the delay appears to be that the model generation engine sometimes starts in a **cold state**, requiring additional time to warm up before producing content.

## **Upcoming Improvements**  

To further enhance reliability, a **polling-based solution** will be implemented. This approach will ensure more consistent API responses while preventing timeouts. However, it requires refactoring the following components:  

- **API Endpoint:** Adjustments to support polling logic.  
- **Loader Component:** Introduction of a new component to handle real-time status updates.  
- **UI Updates:** Enhancements to display loading states and final results more effectively.  

### **Expected Benefits:**  
âœ… More reliable API calls.  
âœ… Improved user experience with real-time status updates.  
âœ… Elimination of timeouts.  
âœ… Better compatibility with a serverless architecture.  

A ticket has been created in the project Kanban to track the implementation of these improvements.
